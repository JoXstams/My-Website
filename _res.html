                <h1>My Interests in IT</h1>
            </header>

        <br> 
            <h3>A little about my interst in Information Technology (IT)</h3>
        <br> 
            <p>I find myself interested in wanting to work in Cloud computing and eventually Artificial Intelligence (AI).Creating the perfect user experience is what I aspire to achieve. I have interest in working with cloud computing as I see it as the future of computing, additionally AI strikes my attention, imagining the future of AI technologies for both business and personal uses. I began considering a career in Information Technology (IT) over the past 3 years, medical diagnoses contributed to me needing to rethink career prospects, then meeting a highly intelligent and influential person (Jonny), I began learning things and realising I have the intelligence to achieve something, despite my chronic medical conditions. I began thinking about what I would like to do if I did learn, and I concluded that I would do well combining my natural ability for attention to detail with IT fundamentals to create the best user experience. I recall back in early high school years doing compulsory IT classes, if I recall correctly, we used JavaScript to create a website, I created a website for my local football club which I was heavily involved with at the time. It was a simple website which contained several hyper-links to different pages, including player profiles, team lists, committee page, a premiership history page etc.
            </p>
        <br><br>
        <br>
            <h3> Study Options</h3>
        <br>
            <p>When I began searching for courses, I was initially looking at User experience (UX)/user interface (UI) design courses, Jonny suggested to me that I start out with basic IT, then move into specialization, that way I cover all bases. 
            Taking that advice into consideration, I began searching for IT courses. 
            There were two courses that I first looked at, 1 came with an internship with IBM, but structured so you had to attend campus in Ballarat, the other was 1 day a week on campus in Melbourne. 
            <a href="https://www.open.edu.au/">Open Universities</a> led me to this course through RMIT, the ease of entry and the open course structure made my decision on the spot, and all online, through one of Australia’s most reputable Technology Institutes.</p>

        <br><br>
        <br>
            <h3>My Expectations of Study</h3>
        <br>
            <p>The ultimate expectation I have from my studies is to be able to competently perform all basic tasks of an IT professional. 
            To elaborate however, I have expectation that I can confidently build, or create, maintain, repair and expand a program. 
            I believe it necessary to have competency in all aspects of IT and therefore expect that throughout the course of studying Bachelor of IT, I will gain competent knowledge in the basic understanding of all IT aspects and be able to perform basic functions on multiple platforms. 
            Alternatively, I expect to learn more about myself, not having a great deal of expose to the ‘creator’ side of IT I still don’t know what to expect of myself! 
            Today I’m saying I’d like to be in design side of things, in 12 months I might be heading for DevOps then in 2 years I end up down a different path like Full Stack Developer - that’s the kind of twists my life throws. 
            So I really am approaching my studies with an open mind and follow the path of strong points and see where it leads.</p>

        <br>
            <h4>What do your results mean to you?</h4>
        <br><p>
                The results from the tests strongly outline my personality and characteristics. 
                I have become Introverted and often find myself presenting the behaviours like preferring to be alone and exploring my interests as described in the test outcomes. I possess the ability to think critically and logically to analyse and make decisions. I learn well through aural channels, and my best output is always when I have music playing. Organization is key for me to stay focused and on track. If I do not have a schedule, I will just forget things.
            </p>    
        <br><br>
            <h4>Influence on your Behaviours in team work</h4> 
        <br><p>
                    I am very self-aware when it comes to working in groups. Being an introvert, I am not one to jump up to take the lead, however I often find myself eventually becoming a leader of some kind. Once people get familiar with me, they tend to look up to me. I do perform my best work alone, and this can be where I have issues working in teams, because you are in fact relying on others, which I tend not to do in my life anymore. My ability to think critically and logically though has been beneficial on more than one occasion. Further, the medical training I have, has taught me the ability to remain calm in critical moments, allowing me to make decisions in a timely manner. 
            </p>
        <br>
            <h4>Behaviours to consider when forming a team</h4>
            <br><p>
                    Being aware of my traits, I am able to notify group members how I behave and apply myself to tasks. Although introverted, I am capable of initiating discussion when I believe there needs to be discussion for progress. I am often one of the first to notice for instance, someone not getting their part done, I will, with instinct, pick up that work on my own accord. I work more efficiently alone, and can seem like I am not engaging, but I usually bring more than my allocated work back to the group.

            <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <br>
            <h4 style="font-style:inherit">Overview</h4>
            <p>
                “MyP.A.” – an Artificial Intelligence Assistant (AIA). Just say something into a microphone and the app will record what you say and create your entry. Your own Personal Assistant that keeps your calendar and schedule and keeps reminders. A shopping/wish list and meal planner that can connect to an online search via browser or installed app. A section for diary entries and notes. Integrated alarm. A budget manager which can connect to installed apps and payment services. Link to Social media accounts. Sync to products like Google nest and Amazon Alexa and make notes or entries by speaking to your home hub.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
                Among the millions of apps available today, Productivity apps are seventh amongst the highest downloaded apps on Google Play Store, with a penetration rate of 91.67% for productivity. In the description of an article of The Financial Express, 2016-09-27; it is quoted that David Willis, suggested that emergence of virtual personal assistants and bots would replace some of the functions performed by apps and the importance of apps delivering services will diminish. With evolving technology and peoples’ demand to have everything they need available in the easiest means, Amazon made this even more achievable in April 2017, when they released a service for building conventional interfaces for all types of virtual assistant or interface.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                The Calendar would keep track of important dates personalised to you, with ability to sync to your other calendars such as Samsung calendar, Google calendar, and other calendar services you might use. The Schedule would give you ability to plan by day, week or month at hourly intervals and would also sync with calendar and all email accounts. Ask your PA to create and manage your reminders and personalize tones and display options and alternative option to send e-mail reminders. Let your ‘MyPA’ know of your appointments, and it will log it everywhere it needs to be, including an email to confirm it has been booked in your schedule. All you need to do is open app and press microphone or use sidebar access and tell your MyPA what you need it to do for you.
                <br>A Shopping list and wish list section, you might have a grocery list saved of items you get regularly and maybe another that changes each week depending on the meals you choose in the integrated meal planner. making it easy to order one or more lists online, or simply have the list(s) easy to access when you’re in the shop. A ‘wish’ list section, where you can search, save and purchase items you may need or be interested in. Both Shopping and wish list as well as integrated meal planner have access to a search which will give you ‘shopping’ search results from you default browser or redirect to shopping apps installed on your phone. A Diary and Notes section, where those who just like to write can enter in the diary entry and if you just need to jot some notes you can do that in the note pad, use your keyboard, voice-to-text or simply say “diary entry” or “note” to your MyPA and when page loads, type or press microphone at top to speak.
                <br>A budget planner and manager, enter information manually or connect to apps or websites of any utility services, rental payment, subscription services and any other service or payments that have app or website payment options. Your MyPA will calculate your budget at your chosen intermittence (weekly, fortnightly, monthly). Sync the budget section to your emails and calendar and arrange for your ‘MyPA’ to set up and complete manual payments on required dates. The budget section will also provide links to some budgeting assistance.
                <br>Sync your MyPA with you home hub eg. Amazon Alexa or Google Nest and talk to your MyPA through your home hub. Link to social media accounts.
                <br>Give your MyPA a name and face, with AI integration, it will become your best friend.
                <br>Permissions to access and sync to external accounts and services like voice-to-text would need to be clarified. Access to a pop-up or sidebar access for quick access, potentially a shortcut or widget from home screen too. Application developers and cloud developers alongside a machine learning architect would need to be involved in entire process of these aspects. Would need to be able to work on Android and Apple devices, consider even Microsoft integration.             
            </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Tools & Technology</h4>

        <h4>Skill Requirements</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left">
                Level of skill required for development of an AIA creation varies depending on the degree of complication of the project itself. 
                <br>Simple creations could require just knowledge of python language and using the tools suggested, today there are many code templates which allow even novice programmers to create an AIA. 
                <br>However, for more complicated projects, such as my idea, the programmer may need further skills such as cloud computing experience, machine learning knowledge and multi-language programming skills. 
                <br>Programming and other IT skills have become widely and easily available to learn, with many learning platforms encompassing multitudes of choices from free basic concepts tutorials to formal learning.

        <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>
                “MyPA” on completion would provide customers with a virtual personal assistant that can be used for personal, work and business purposes. 
                <br>The concept of AIA’s is becoming more prominent in how businesses operate, and this will soon be a thing in personal everyday lives. 
                <br>With AIA technologies, the time where we can use an assistant to keep us organised is on approach, without big diaries and notebooks or even sticky notes. Also not have to hire a personal assistant would save money for many. 
                <br>MyPA will make organizing your life simpler than ever before.
